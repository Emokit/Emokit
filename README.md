EmoKit—the best emotion reading API in the world, for free! Emokit is the emotion reading engine developed by Emokit Technology Co. Ltd., which aims at providing accurate, fluent, powerful and open emotion reading and content matching services. We can read emotion by voice, heart rate, pace and breath and then search the relevant music to match user’s emotion and physiological data. For a three minute song, we can collect about 6000 data points from its pitch, tone, melody, and volume to analyze. So far we have already finished this work on 10,000,000 songs.
